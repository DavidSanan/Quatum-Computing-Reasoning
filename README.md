# Quatum-Computing-Reasoning
Isabelle HOL semantics and Hoare Logic with Separation for reasoning in Quantum Computing

This work based of our semantics for quantum computing. This mechanization adds some changes for a better fitting of the non-mechanized semantics into the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover. It also adds some small improvements over the original semantics.
